flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Hey everyone! I know it has been a long time coming, but we finally have an update on the Starfinder side of things. With the addition of Mechageddon!, we are finally caught up on getting all of the books up on the site. That does not mean that we are done. We expect to continue to fix bugs as they come up, so keep reporting them!
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | We're also ramping up our Starfinder 2nd Edition preperation and are looking for another data entry specialist that can help us get things onboard with everything. We're looking for a few criteria in this specialist:
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Enjoys Starfinder and/or Pathfinder 2E
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Has a few hours a week they can contribute towards data entry
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Able to assist for the foreseeable long-term (at least up through SF2E's release, ideally longer)
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | If you're interested in helping out, along with the benefits of joining, please email jointeam@archivesofnethys.com. If you've already emailed us before and are still interested, please send us another email to express your continued interest. We will prioritize people we've spoken to already in the past if they are still able to help out.

This update brings new content in the way of the final issue of the Angels of the Drift Comic along with content from the Scoured Stars AP. We'd also like to announce that we've brought on a new team member named JonDemand! Jon is a British IT nerd and avid Starfinder GM/Player, along with being responsible for putting together the Starfinder Society modules for Foundry as part of Metamorphic Digital. Jon will be looking after the bug fixes, as well as the data entry for Mechageddon when it releases.

flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Hi all, happy holidays! Just in time for the new year, the team has finished adding in Starfinder Enhanced (a worthy endeavor, congrats to the data entry team!), along with other new books to the archives. We're sorry it took us this long - the team gets very busy this time of year and it's hard to predict when we can get the new releases done. As some of you may have seen, we put out the word for a new person to help with data entry here and are hoping to onboard them in the new year. That should help us keep up with the remaining SF1e releases and prep for the upcoming 2nd edition release.
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Until then, please enjoy the Archives!

flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Curses, diseases, drugs, and poisons can all have effects on a character that continue long past the character’s first exposure. This deterioration in physical or mental health is often represented by what is called a “progression track.” Diseases and poisons each have default progression tracks whose steps have specific rules consequences; drugs use the relevant poison track (for example, drugs that affect Wisdom use the Wisdom poison track). Some specific afflictions have their own unique progression tracks defined in their stat blocks. Curses generally do not use progression tracks—their effects continue until they’re cured without progressing through stages.
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Before an individual is subjected to an affliction, she is considered healthy in terms of the affliction’s progression track, if any. When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For diseases, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the disease along to others if it’s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For poisons, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Diseases and poisons each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug’s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the drug acts as a disease (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Each progression track has an end state—a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn’t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, diseases, poisons, and drugs have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Some afflictions cause the same effects as a condition (such as sickened; see page 277). Effects that modify, prevent, or remove those conditions do not apply; only effects and immunities against the appropriate affliction apply.
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Curing an Affliction
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | : Diseases, drugs, and poisons can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease’s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons and drugs work differently—fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a poison’s duration) removes a poison from the victim’s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see Long-Term Care on page 143), though tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period.
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Curses can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | Usually, the spell

flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.157 | (see page 373) immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track). However, once a disease or poison has reached its end state, only the most powerful magic or technology (such as

flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.158 | If a creature takes a drug while it has progressed beyond healthy on the drug’s progression track, the DC of the saving throw against addiction increases by 2. A creature can attempt a save against an addiction only on a day when it hasn’t taken the drug. Each day spent without using the drug decreases the addiction’s DC by 2, to a minimum of the starting DC, but using the drug again, even once, returns the DC to its highest value. Each drug addiction is a separate disease.

flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.159 | Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see Afflictions on page 414.

flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.160 | Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. It’s also possible to add a dose of poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand.

flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.161 | Effect
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.161 | Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.
flask  | 2025-06-21 12:59:16.161 | A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting
