flask  | 2025-06-18 22:44:46.454 | Corruption is an insidious affliction of the soul. A number of different corruptions exist, from the mind-rending horror of ghostly possession to the monstrous physical transformation of lycanthropy. However, all corruptions function in a similar way. When a character first contracts a corruption, it shows itself in minor symptoms—brief bouts of melancholy or a mild fixation on unusual stimuli or a particular environment. The corruption eats away at the victim’s mind and spirit with the promise of dark gifts that come with frightful drawbacks. Fighting these temptations is draining on a victim, and some spend their entire lives on the verge of giving in. Others believe they can control their corruption, and allow the corruption to progress in order to gain the power it grants. Such beings eventually become completely defiled as corruption takes a permanent hold over them.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:44:46.469 | Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see Afflictions on page 414.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:44:46.482 | Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. It’s also possible to add a dose of poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:44:46.487 | Effect
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:44:46.487 | Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:44:46.487 | A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Hey everyone! I know it has been a long time coming, but we finally have an update on the Starfinder side of things. With the addition of Mechageddon!, we are finally caught up on getting all of the books up on the site. That does not mean that we are done. We expect to continue to fix bugs as they come up, so keep reporting them!
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | We're also ramping up our Starfinder 2nd Edition preperation and are looking for another data entry specialist that can help us get things onboard with everything. We're looking for a few criteria in this specialist:

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Hi all, happy holidays! Just in time for the new year, the team has finished adding in Starfinder Enhanced (a worthy endeavor, congrats to the data entry team!), along with other new books to the archives. We're sorry it took us this long - the team gets very busy this time of year and it's hard to predict when we can get the new releases done. As some of you may have seen, we put out the word for a new person to help with data entry here and are hoping to onboard them in the new year. That should help us keep up with the remaining SF1e releases and prep for the upcoming 2nd edition release.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Curses, diseases, drugs, and poisons can all have effects on a character that continue long past the character’s first exposure. This deterioration in physical or mental health is often represented by what is called a “progression track.” Diseases and poisons each have default progression tracks whose steps have specific rules consequences; drugs use the relevant poison track (for example, drugs that affect Wisdom use the Wisdom poison track). Some specific afflictions have their own unique progression tracks defined in their stat blocks. Curses generally do not use progression tracks—their effects continue until they’re cured without progressing through stages.
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Before an individual is subjected to an affliction, she is considered healthy in terms of the affliction’s progression track, if any. When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For diseases, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the disease along to others if it’s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For poisons, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Diseases and poisons each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug’s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the drug acts as a disease (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Each progression track has an end state—a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn’t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, diseases, poisons, and drugs have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Some afflictions cause the same effects as a condition (such as sickened; see page 277). Effects that modify, prevent, or remove those conditions do not apply; only effects and immunities against the appropriate affliction apply.
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Curing an Affliction
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | : Diseases, drugs, and poisons can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease’s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons and drugs work differently—fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a poison’s duration) removes a poison from the victim’s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see Long-Term Care on page 143), though tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period.
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Curses can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Usually, the spell

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | (see page 373) immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track). However, once a disease or poison has reached its end state, only the most powerful magic or technology (such as

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | or

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | or a regeneration chamber) can remove its effects.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.382 | Corruption is an insidious affliction of the soul. A number of different corruptions exist, from the mind-rending horror of ghostly possession to the monstrous physical transformation of lycanthropy. However, all corruptions function in a similar way. When a character first contracts a corruption, it shows itself in minor symptoms—brief bouts of melancholy or a mild fixation on unusual stimuli or a particular environment. The corruption eats away at the victim’s mind and spirit with the promise of dark gifts that come with frightful drawbacks. Fighting these temptations is draining on a victim, and some spend their entire lives on the verge of giving in. Others believe they can control their corruption, and allow the corruption to progress in order to gain the power it grants. Such beings eventually become completely defiled as corruption takes a permanent hold over them.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.383 | If a creature takes a drug while it has progressed beyond healthy on the drug’s progression track, the DC of the saving throw against addiction increases by 2. A creature can attempt a save against an addiction only on a day when it hasn’t taken the drug. Each day spent without using the drug decreases the addiction’s DC by 2, to a minimum of the starting DC, but using the drug again, even once, returns the DC to its highest value. Each drug addiction is a separate disease.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.384 | Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see Afflictions on page 414.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.386 | Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. It’s also possible to add a dose of poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand.

flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.387 | Effect
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.387 | Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.
flask  | 2025-06-18 22:54:37.387 | A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting

Let's analyze these toxic substances with a calm, analytical tone, shall we?\n\n**EDI's Analysis**\n\nThe Starfinder universe is home to various deadly poisons, each with its unique effects. These toxins can be categorized into different types: emanation, contact, injury, ingested, and inhaled.\n\n1. **Emanation Poisons**: Radiation is a notable example of an emanation poison. It's an area-of-effect poison that suffuses the air and can affect creatures within its range.\n2. **Contact Poisons**: Cyanide and Hydrofluoric Acid are two examples of contact poisons. They cause immediate harm when a creature comes into contact with them.\n\n3. **Injury Poisons**: Deathblade, Dragon Ray, Radium, and Strychnine are all injury-based poisons that can be delivered through physical means (e.g., bite, sting).\n\n4. **Ingested Poisons**: Black Lotus Extract, Blue Whinnis, Docilant, Green Lotus Extract, Id Moss, Mindhaze, Shadow Essence, Turbocurarine, and Ungol Dust are all ingested poisons that can be consumed through food or drink.\n\n5. **Inhaled Poisons**: Cyanide, Hydrofluoric Acid, Insanity Mist, Radium, and Ungol Dust are also inhaled poisons, which can cause harm when breathed in.\n\n**EDI's Observations**\n\n* Some poisons have a gradual effect (e.g., radiation), while others have an immediate impact.\n* Certain poisons can be neutralized or removed through specific actions (e.g., removing radioactivity).\n* The progression track for some poisons is more linear, while others have multiple stages of impairment.\n\n**EDI's Conclusion**\n\nIn the Starfinder universe, understanding the properties and effects of various poisons is crucial for survival.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.482 | Hey everyone! I know it has been a long time coming, but we finally have an update on the Starfinder side of things. With the addition of Mechageddon!, we are finally caught up on getting all of the books up on the site. That does not mean that we are done. We expect to continue to fix bugs as they come up, so keep reporting them!
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.482 | We're also ramping up our Starfinder 2nd Edition preperation and are looking for another data entry specialist that can help us get things onboard with everything. We're looking for a few criteria in this specialist:

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.482 | Hi all, happy holidays! Just in time for the new year, the team has finished adding in Starfinder Enhanced (a worthy endeavor, congrats to the data entry team!), along with other new books to the archives. We're sorry it took us this long - the team gets very busy this time of year and it's hard to predict when we can get the new releases done. As some of you may have seen, we put out the word for a new person to help with data entry here and are hoping to onboard them in the new year. That should help us keep up with the remaining SF1e releases and prep for the upcoming 2nd edition release.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.482 | Curses, diseases, drugs, and poisons can all have effects on a character that continue long past the character’s first exposure. This deterioration in physical or mental health is often represented by what is called a “progression track.” Diseases and poisons each have default progression tracks whose steps have specific rules consequences; drugs use the relevant poison track (for example, drugs that affect Wisdom use the Wisdom poison track). Some specific afflictions have their own unique progression tracks defined in their stat blocks. Curses generally do not use progression tracks—their effects continue until they’re cured without progressing through stages.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | Before an individual is subjected to an affliction, she is considered healthy in terms of the affliction’s progression track, if any. When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For diseases, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the disease along to others if it’s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For poisons, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | Diseases and poisons each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug’s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the drug acts as a disease (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | Each progression track has an end state—a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn’t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, diseases, poisons, and drugs have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | Some afflictions cause the same effects as a condition (such as sickened; see page 277). Effects that modify, prevent, or remove those conditions do not apply; only effects and immunities against the appropriate affliction apply.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | Curing an Affliction
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | : Diseases, drugs, and poisons can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease’s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons and drugs work differently—fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a poison’s duration) removes a poison from the victim’s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see Long-Term Care on page 143), though tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | Curses can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | Usually, the spell

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | (see page 373) immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track). However, once a disease or poison has reached its end state, only the most powerful magic or technology (such as

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | or

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | or a regeneration chamber) can remove its effects.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.483 | Corruption is an insidious affliction of the soul. A number of different corruptions exist, from the mind-rending horror of ghostly possession to the monstrous physical transformation of lycanthropy. However, all corruptions function in a similar way. When a character first contracts a corruption, it shows itself in minor symptoms—brief bouts of melancholy or a mild fixation on unusual stimuli or a particular environment. The corruption eats away at the victim’s mind and spirit with the promise of dark gifts that come with frightful drawbacks. Fighting these temptations is draining on a victim, and some spend their entire lives on the verge of giving in. Others believe they can control their corruption, and allow the corruption to progress in order to gain the power it grants. Such beings eventually become completely defiled as corruption takes a permanent hold over them.

A creature can attempt a save against an addiction only on a day when it hasn’t taken the drug. Each day spent without using the drug decreases the addiction’s DC by 2, to a minimum of the starting DC, but using the drug again, even once, returns the DC to its highest value. Each drug addiction is a separate disease.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.485 | Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see Afflictions on page 414.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.486 | Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. It’s also possible to add a dose of poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.487 | Effect
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.487 | Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:23:58.487 | A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting

Here's a breakdown of each poison:\n\n**Poisons with no cure**\n\n* Radium: At the impaired state, penalties from the weakened state become permanent until the victim benefits from a restoration spell.\n* Shadow Essence: At the impaired state, penalties from the weakened state become permanent until the victim benefits from a restoration spell.\n\n**Poisons with two consecutive saves to cure**\n\n* Cyanide: Requires 2 consecutive saves to cure.\n* Hydrofluoric Acid: Requires 2 consecutive saves to cure.\n* Id Moss: Requires 1 save to cure.\n* Insanity Mist: Requires 1 save to cure.\n* Mindhaze: Requires 1 save to cure.\n\n**Poisons with no cure, but removal of radiation does**\n\n* Radium (radiation): Requires rest to recover from radiation poisoning. Removing the source of radiation or casting remove radioactivity has the same effect.\n* Strychnine: Progression track is Healthy—Stiffened—Immobile—Dead.\n\nNote that some poisons have additional effects, such as:\n\n* Deathblade: Progression track is Sluggish—Stiffened—Staggered—Immobile; no end state. Immobile victims can continue to attempt a saving throw each round as a full-round action to revert to stiffened.\n* Turbocurarine: Progression track is Sluggish—Stiffened—Staggered—Immobile; no end state.\n\nIt's worth noting that some poisons have specific requirements or effects, such as:\n\n* Green Lotus Extract: Requires 2 consecutive saves to cure.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Hey everyone! I know it has been a long time coming, but we finally have an update on the Starfinder side of things. With the addition of Mechageddon!, we are finally caught up on getting all of the books up on the site. That does not mean that we are done. We expect to continue to fix bugs as they come up, so keep reporting them!
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | We're also ramping up our Starfinder 2nd Edition preperation and are looking for another data entry specialist that can help us get things onboard with everything. We're looking for a few criteria in this specialist:

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Hi all, happy holidays! Just in time for the new year, the team has finished adding in Starfinder Enhanced (a worthy endeavor, congrats to the data entry team!), along with other new books to the archives. We're sorry it took us this long - the team gets very busy this time of year and it's hard to predict when we can get the new releases done. As some of you may have seen, we put out the word for a new person to help with data entry here and are hoping to onboard them in the new year. That should help us keep up with the remaining SF1e releases and prep for the upcoming 2nd edition release.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Curses, diseases, drugs, and poisons can all have effects on a character that continue long past the character’s first exposure. This deterioration in physical or mental health is often represented by what is called a “progression track.” Diseases and poisons each have default progression tracks whose steps have specific rules consequences; drugs use the relevant poison track (for example, drugs that affect Wisdom use the Wisdom poison track). Some specific afflictions have their own unique progression tracks defined in their stat blocks. Curses generally do not use progression tracks—their effects continue until they’re cured without progressing through stages.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Before an individual is subjected to an affliction, she is considered healthy in terms of the affliction’s progression track, if any. When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For diseases, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the disease along to others if it’s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For poisons, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Diseases and poisons each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug’s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the drug acts as a disease (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Each progression track has an end state—a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn’t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, diseases, poisons, and drugs have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Some afflictions cause the same effects as a condition (such as sickened; see page 277). Effects that modify, prevent, or remove those conditions do not apply; only effects and immunities against the appropriate affliction apply.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Curing an Affliction
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | : Diseases, drugs, and poisons can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease’s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons and drugs work differently—fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a poison’s duration) removes a poison from the victim’s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see Long-Term Care on page 143), though tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Curses can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Usually, the spell

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | (see page 373) immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track). However, once a disease or poison has reached its end state, only the most powerful magic or technology (such as

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.690 | Corruption is an insidious affliction of the soul. A number of different corruptions exist, from the mind-rending horror of ghostly possession to the monstrous physical transformation of lycanthropy. However, all corruptions function in a similar way. When a character first contracts a corruption, it shows itself in minor symptoms—brief bouts of melancholy or a mild fixation on unusual stimuli or a particular environment. The corruption eats away at the victim’s mind and spirit with the promise of dark gifts that come with frightful drawbacks. Fighting these temptations is draining on a victim, and some spend their entire lives on the verge of giving in. Others believe they can control their corruption, and allow the corruption to progress in order to gain the power it grants. Such beings eventually become completely defiled as corruption takes a permanent hold over them.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.691 | If a creature takes a drug while it has progressed beyond healthy on the drug’s progression track, the DC of the saving throw against addiction increases by 2. A creature can attempt a save against an addiction only on a day when it hasn’t taken the drug. Each day spent without using the drug decreases the addiction’s DC by 2, to a minimum of the starting DC, but using the drug again, even once, returns the DC to its highest value. Each drug addiction is a separate disease.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.691 | Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see Afflictions on page 414.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.693 | Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. It’s also possible to add a dose of poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.693 | Effect
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.693 | Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:33:38.693 | A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.801 | Hey everyone! I know it has been a long time coming, but we finally have an update on the Starfinder side of things. With the addition of Mechageddon!, we are finally caught up on getting all of the books up on the site. That does not mean that we are done. We expect to continue to fix bugs as they come up, so keep reporting them!
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.801 | We're also ramping up our Starfinder 2nd Edition preperation and are looking for another data entry specialist that can help us get things onboard with everything. We're looking for a few criteria in this specialist:

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.801 | Hi all, happy holidays! Just in time for the new year, the team has finished adding in Starfinder Enhanced (a worthy endeavor, congrats to the data entry team!), along with other new books to the archives. We're sorry it took us this long - the team gets very busy this time of year and it's hard to predict when we can get the new releases done. As some of you may have seen, we put out the word for a new person to help with data entry here and are hoping to onboard them in the new year. That should help us keep up with the remaining SF1e releases and prep for the upcoming 2nd edition release.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Curses, diseases, drugs, and poisons can all have effects on a character that continue long past the character’s first exposure. This deterioration in physical or mental health is often represented by what is called a “progression track.” Diseases and poisons each have default progression tracks whose steps have specific rules consequences; drugs use the relevant poison track (for example, drugs that affect Wisdom use the Wisdom poison track). Some specific afflictions have their own unique progression tracks defined in their stat blocks. Curses generally do not use progression tracks—their effects continue until they’re cured without progressing through stages.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Before an individual is subjected to an affliction, she is considered healthy in terms of the affliction’s progression track, if any. When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For diseases, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the disease along to others if it’s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For poisons, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Diseases and poisons each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug’s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the drug acts as a disease (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Each progression track has an end state—a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn’t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, diseases, poisons, and drugs have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Some afflictions cause the same effects as a condition (such as sickened; see page 277). Effects that modify, prevent, or remove those conditions do not apply; only effects and immunities against the appropriate affliction apply.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Curing an Affliction
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | : Diseases, drugs, and poisons can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease’s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons and drugs work differently—fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a poison’s duration) removes a poison from the victim’s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see Long-Term Care on page 143), though tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Curses can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Usually, the spell

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | (see page 373) immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track). However, once a disease or poison has reached its end state, only the most powerful magic or technology (such as

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | or

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | , or in the most extreme cases,

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | or a regeneration chamber) can remove its effects.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.802 | Corruption is an insidious affliction of the soul. A number of different corruptions exist, from the mind-rending horror of ghostly possession to the monstrous physical transformation of lycanthropy. However, all corruptions function in a similar way. When a character first contracts a corruption, it shows itself in minor symptoms—brief bouts of melancholy or a mild fixation on unusual stimuli or a particular environment. The corruption eats away at the victim’s mind and spirit with the promise of dark gifts that come with frightful drawbacks. Fighting these temptations is draining on a victim, and some spend their entire lives on the verge of giving in. Others believe they can control their corruption, and allow the corruption to progress in order to gain the power it grants. Such beings eventually become completely defiled as corruption takes a permanent hold over them.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.803 | If a creature takes a drug while it has progressed beyond healthy on the drug’s progression track, the DC of the saving throw against addiction increases by 2. A creature can attempt a save against an addiction only on a day when it hasn’t taken the drug. Each day spent without using the drug decreases the addiction’s DC by 2, to a minimum of the starting DC, but using the drug again, even once, returns the DC to its highest value. Each drug addiction is a separate disease.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.803 | Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see Afflictions on page 414.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.804 | Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. It’s also possible to add a dose of poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.805 | Effect
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.805 | Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:40:47.805 | A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting

poisoning, can also cure poison effects.\n* **Remove Affliction**: This spell can remove the affliction of a poison without curing it.\n* **Remove Radioactivity**: This spell can remove the affliction of radiation poisoning without curing it.\n\n**Notable Poisons**\n\nSome poisons stand out due to their unique effects or properties:\n\n* **Black Lotus Extract**: A highly potent contact poison that

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.894 | Hey everyone! I know it has been a long time coming, but we finally have an update on the Starfinder side of things. With the addition of Mechageddon!, we are finally caught up on getting all of the books up on the site. That does not mean that we are done. We expect to continue to fix bugs as they come up, so keep reporting them!
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.894 | We're also ramping up our Starfinder 2nd Edition preperation and are looking for another data entry specialist that can help us get things onboard with everything. We're looking for a few criteria in this specialist:

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.894 | Hi all, happy holidays! Just in time for the new year, the team has finished adding in Starfinder Enhanced (a worthy endeavor, congrats to the data entry team!), along with other new books to the archives. We're sorry it took us this long - the team gets very busy this time of year and it's hard to predict when we can get the new releases done. As some of you may have seen, we put out the word for a new person to help with data entry here and are hoping to onboard them in the new year. That should help us keep up with the remaining SF1e releases and prep for the upcoming 2nd edition release.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Curses, diseases, drugs, and poisons can all have effects on a character that continue long past the character’s first exposure. This deterioration in physical or mental health is often represented by what is called a “progression track.” Diseases and poisons each have default progression tracks whose steps have specific rules consequences; drugs use the relevant poison track (for example, drugs that affect Wisdom use the Wisdom poison track). Some specific afflictions have their own unique progression tracks defined in their stat blocks. Curses generally do not use progression tracks—their effects continue until they’re cured without progressing through stages.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Before an individual is subjected to an affliction, she is considered healthy in terms of the affliction’s progression track, if any. When initially is targeted by an affliction, she must succeed at a saving throw to avoid its effects; if she fails, she is subject to the affliction. If the affliction has a progression track, she is no longer considered healthy with respect to that affliction and immediately gains the effects of the first step on its progression track. For diseases, this is the typically the latent state; at this step, the victim can pass the disease along to others if it’s contagious, but generally suffers no ill effects from it herself. For poisons, the first step on the progression track is usually the weakened step. A truly deadly affliction might cause the victim to start further along a progression track than normal.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Diseases and poisons each have a listed frequency specifying how often a victim must attempt subsequent saving throws to prevent the affliction from progressing. Success could help the victim recover (see Curing an Affliction below); failure means that the victim moves one step further along its progression track, gaining the effects of the next step and keeping all previous effects. A character using a drug must attempt a saving throw each time she uses that drug. Victims typically fail voluntarily, progressing along the drug’s progression track in exchange for benefits, and withdrawal from the drug acts as a disease (see the stat block for Addiction on page 418).
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Each progression track has an end state—a point at which the affliction has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn’t suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction (see below). By default, diseases, poisons, and drugs have an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, while others might have no end state, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Some afflictions cause the same effects as a condition (such as sickened; see page 277). Effects that modify, prevent, or remove those conditions do not apply; only effects and immunities against the appropriate affliction apply.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Curing an Affliction
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | : Diseases, drugs, and poisons can be cured if they are treated before the victim reaches the end state. In the case of a disease, the victim must fulfill the conditions in the disease’s Cure entry (usually succeeding at one or more consecutive saving throws). Each time she does so, she moves one step back toward healthy; once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons and drugs work differently—fulfilling the cure condition (or reaching the end of a poison’s duration) removes a poison from the victim’s system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. For every day of bed rest (or two nights of normal rest), a victim moves one step toward healthy. This rate of recovery is doubled by successful Medicine checks (see Long-Term Care on page 143), though tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Curses can be cured only by fulfilling the unique cure conditions listed in their individual stat blocks or through magic.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Usually, the spell

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | (see page 373) immediately cures a victim of an affliction (moving the victim of a disease, drug, or poison to a healthy state on its progression track). However, once a disease or poison has reached its end state, only the most powerful magic or technology (such as

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | or

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | , or in the most extreme cases,

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | or a regeneration chamber) can remove its effects.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Corruption is an insidious affliction of the soul. A number of different corruptions exist, from the mind-rending horror of ghostly possession to the monstrous physical transformation of lycanthropy. However, all corruptions function in a similar way. When a character first contracts a corruption, it shows itself in minor symptoms—brief bouts of melancholy or a mild fixation on unusual stimuli or a particular environment. The corruption eats away at the victim’s mind and spirit with the promise of dark gifts that come with frightful drawbacks. Fighting these temptations is draining on a victim, and some spend their entire lives on the verge of giving in. Others believe they can control their corruption, and allow the corruption to progress in order to gain the power it grants. Such beings eventually become completely defiled as corruption takes a permanent hold over them.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Effect
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | When the victim takes a full night’s rest (8 hours of sleep or more), they constantly toss and turn, recovering only 1 HP, instead of 1 HP per character level. If they undergo complete bed rest for 24 hours, they recover only 1 HP per character level, instead of 2 HP per character level.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | Cure
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.895 | The victim must remain awake for a continuous 72-hour period, attempting the normal Fortitude saving throws against sleep deprivation. If they fall victim to a spell or effect that causes the asleep condition during this time, they must begin the 72 hours over again when they wake up.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.896 | If a creature takes a drug while it has progressed beyond healthy on the drug’s progression track, the DC of the saving throw against addiction increases by 2. A creature can attempt a save against an addiction only on a day when it hasn’t taken the drug. Each day spent without using the drug decreases the addiction’s DC by 2, to a minimum of the starting DC, but using the drug again, even once, returns the DC to its highest value. Each drug addiction is a separate disease.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.896 | Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see Afflictions on page 414.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.898 | Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an injection glove or needler pistol. It’s also possible to add a dose of poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand.

flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.898 | Effect
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.898 | Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.
flask  | 2025-06-18 23:45:55.898 | A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting
